# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Current Status

✅ **Built static files created in `/docs` folder**
✅ **GitHub Pages can now detect the `/docs` folder for hosting**

## Important Limitation

⚠️ **This React application requires a backend server** for:
- Database operations (PostgreSQL)
- User authentication
- Admin panel functionality
- API endpoints for applications, payments, etc.

**GitHub Pages only hosts static files** and cannot run the Express.js server.

## Deployment Options

### 1. **Recommended: Replit Deployments**
- Full-stack support with database
- Automatic HTTPS and custom domains
- Built-in environment variable management
- No additional setup required

### 2. **Alternative: Vercel/Netlify + Separate Database**
- Host the React app on Vercel/Netlify
- Use a separate database service (Neon, PlanetScale, etc.)
- Configure environment variables for production

### 3. **GitHub Pages (Limited)**
- Only the frontend will work
- All backend features will fail:
  - No user authentication
  - No database operations
  - No admin panel
  - No application submissions

## Files Ready for GitHub Pages

The `/docs` folder contains:
- `index.html` - Main app entry point
- `assets/` - All CSS, JS, and image assets
- Optimized production build (571KB main bundle)

## To Enable GitHub Pages

1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Go to repository Settings → Pages
3. Source: Deploy from a branch
4. Branch: main, Folder: /docs
5. Save

**Note:** Only the visual interface will work - all functionality requiring the backend will fail.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Deploy to Replit for full functionality
2. Or set up Vercel deployment with external database
3. Keep GitHub Pages as a demo/preview version
